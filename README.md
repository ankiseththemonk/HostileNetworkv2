HostileNetworkv2
================

Now with less +, and more #!

Second attempt at writing a UDP client/server to send/receive files over a hostile network (i.e., a network that
will pseudo-randomly drop or corrupt packets).

First attempt was in C++; it was decided that WinSock is a total nightmare to code around. Now, this attempt is in C#.
